# Webay Forum

Webay Forum is a forum backend for the Webay webstore.

## Dependencies

pymongo

## Documentation

# Webay Forum Initial Proposal.

## Introduction

### Project description

Webay is a mock webstore with thousands of fake listings for sale.
Webay will also feature a forum in which users can interact with one another.
This module is the framework upon which the user forum will be developed.

### Objective/Purpose

The purpose of creating a user forum is to allow Webay users to interact with
one another without needing a third party forum or other means of interaction.
The forum can also be used for discussing and solving technical issues with the
Webay website itself.

## Background/Related studies

### Background knowledge that led to inspiration.

Creating a user forum will require handling of large amounts of text data.
Managing and sorting through this data will provide good experience for
our group members.

### Summaries and notes from your sources (e.g., research papers)

## Methods

### Your implementation plan (e.g., using open-source libraries such as Tensorflow or algorithms that you've found from research articles)

### What other sources would be available (e.g., Github, StackOverflow, etc)

## Discussion

### Potential Challenges that you expect to see

We expect challenges to arise in sorting through text data, in search of specified
keywords and search terms entered by the user.

### What you expect to learn from this project

## Reference

### Your resources, at least two academic articles (e.g., book or research paper)
